Improving the productivity of farm animals is one of the major challenges. In forest zone agricultural fields humans and animal conflict is a major problem where large amounts of crops are lost and farmers' lives are in danger. Because of this farmers lose their crops, farm equipment, and sometimes farmers live. So this zone is to be watched continuously to protect the agricultural field from the entry of wild animals.Nowadays, one more important factor causing crop loss is an animal intrusion into the farm field.Wild animals cause special challenges to the farmers across the globe. Forest animals such as elephants, wild boar and deer etc. migrate into the nearby agricultural fields in search of food and cause a huge damage to the crops not only by eating but also by trampling the crops by foot, in some areas crop damage to the extent of 50-60% and sometimes 100% crop is damaged by wild animals. This paper presents the assessment of crop damage caused by wild animals in eastern coastal region of Odisha and discusses the feasibility and economic aspects of installation of acoustic equipment to keep the wild animals away from the agricultural fields.While crossing the road in forest area alot of animals are dying because of accidents.
